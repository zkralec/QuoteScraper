# The purpose of this program is to help me learn more about Python programs and their uses. I am creating a program that will be able to scrape information off of websites and return them back to the user. For example, this program will be able to go to a website for a restaraunt, take information from the website such as reviews and comments, and give them to the user in order to help the user decide if they want to eat there or not.
