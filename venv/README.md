The purpose of this program is to help me learn more about Python programs and their uses. I am creating a program that will be able to scrape information off of websites and return them back to the user. For example, this program will scrape quotes and authors off of 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/' and put them into a CSV file for the user. Eventually, I will take what I have learned from this program and turn it into a larger, more fledged out program.
